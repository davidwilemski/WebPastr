WebPastr
============

History
-------

I created this for two reasons:

1. I wanted to create a custom query for Alfred that would allow me to paste to paste bin.
2. I wanted to learn about the structure of App Engine applications.

This simple project serves both of these purposes well.

Use
-------

To create a new paste bin snippet simply add the text you want to paste after the URL in the /post page's  `code` GET variable. This will load a page that contains just the paste bin URL that has your text. Let's look at an example using http://webpastr.appspot.com.

### Example:

	http://webpastr.appspot.com/post?code=[my_text_here]

### Output:

	http://pastebin.com/c5CLFVvr

### That's it!
